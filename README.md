## Requirements
- A [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/store/index.html) or Arduino
  - uses native keyboard library for Arduino and Joystick library for Teensy
- Python 3.8-3.12
    - virtualenv
- Node 12-16 (needs updating for 17+)
  - yarn

## Hardware setup
Follow a guide like [fsr-pad-guide](https://github.com/Sereni/fsr-pad-guide) or [fsr](https://github.com/vlnguyen/itg-fsr/tree/master/fsr) to setup your Arduino/Teensy with FSRs.

## Firmware setup
1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (skip this if you're using OSX as it's included in Teensyduino)
1. Install [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) and get it connected to your Teensy and able to push firmware via Arduino IDE
1. In Arduino IDE, set the `Tools` > `USB Type` to `Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick` (or `Serial + Keyboard + Mouse`)
1. In Arduino IDE, set the `Tools` > `Board` to your microcontroller (e.g. `Teensy 4.0`)
1. In Arduino IDE, set the `Tools` > `Port` to select the serial port for the plugged in microcontroller (e.g. `COM5` or `/dev/something`)
1. Load [fsr.ino](./fsr.ino) in Arduino IDE.
1. By default, [A0-A3 are the pins](https://forum.pjrc.com/teensy40_pinout1.png) used for the FSR sensors in this software. If you aren't using these pins [alter the SensorState array](./fsr.ino#L509-L531)
1. Push the code to the board

### Testing and using the serial monitor
1. Open `Tools` > `Serial Monitor` to open the Serial Monitor
1. Within the serial monitor, enter `t` to show current thresholds.
1. You can change a sensor threshold by entering numbers, where the first number is the sensor (0-indexed) followed by the threshold value. For example, `3 180` would set the 4th sensor to a threshold of 180.  You can change these more easily in the UI later.
1. Enter `v` to get the current sensor values.
1. Putting pressure on an FSR, you should notice the values change if you enter `v` again while maintaining pressure.


## UI setup
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On Linux you can install Python with your distribution's package manager. On some systems you might have to additionally install the python3 header files (usually called `python3-dev` or similar).
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable). A quick way to do this is with NPM: `npm install -g yarn`
1. Within [server.py](./webui/server/server.py), edit the `SERIAL_PORT` constant to match the serial port shown in the Arduino IDE (e.g. it might look like `"/dev/ttyACM0"` or `"COM1"`)
    - You also may need to [modify](https://github.com/teejusb/fsr/pull/1#discussion_r514585060) the `sensor_numbers` variable.
1. Open a command prompt (or terminal) and navigate to `./webui/server` with `cd webui/server`
1. Run `python -m venv venv` (you may need to replace `python` with `py` on Windows or potentially `python3` on Linux)
1. Run `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Linux you run `source venv/bin/activate`)
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies (might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` on Linux)
1. Then move to the `./webui` directory by doing `cd ..`
1. Run `yarn install && yarn build && yarn start-api`
    - On Linux, you'll also need to edit the `start-api` script in `./webui/package.json` to reference `venv/bin/python` instead of `venv/Scripts/python`

The UI should be up and running on http://localhost:5000 and you can use your device IP and the port to reach it from your phone (e.g. http://192.168.0.xxx:5000 )


## Troubleshooting 
- If you use localhost in your browser and if the UI looks choppy, try using your local IP instead
- If you see the following error, ensure the "Serial Monitor" isn't already open in Arduino IDE `serial.serialutil.SerialException: [Errno 16] could not open port /dev/cu.usbmodem83828101: [Errno 16] Resource busy: '/dev/cu.usbmodem83828101`
- If you notice that your input is delayed and perhaps that delay increases over time, you can sometimes rectify that by restarting the server. Close your `start-api` window and run it again.

## Tips
### Make a desktop shortcut (Windows)
Create a new text file called `start_fsrs.bat` and place it on your desktop.
```bat
start "" http://YOUR_PC_NAME_OR_IP:5000/
cd C:\Users\YourUser\path\to\fsr\webui
yarn start-api
```
Now you can just click on that file to open the UI and start the server.


## Joystick Support on Arduino Leonardo and Pro Micro

The FSR firmware will configure Teensy devices as USB joysticks, and other Arduino devices as USB keyboards. Some Arduino boards such as the Arduino Leonardo and Sparkfun's Pro Micro can be configured as Joysticks using an additional third-party library.

Install ArduinoJoystickLibrary, by following the installation instructions in that project's readme. https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary#installation-instructions

> 1. Download https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary/archive/master.zip
> 2. In the Arduino IDE, select Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library.... Browse to where the downloaded ZIP file is located and click Open.

Find this line, and remove the slashes at the beginning to uncomment it.
```c++
// #define USE_ARDUINO_JOYSTICK_LIBRARY
```

```c++
#define USE_ARDUINO_JOYSTICK_LIBRARY
```

## Support for RP2040

The RP2040 is the microcontroller used by the Raspberry Pi Pico. The Pi Pico only exposes 3 analog input pins, but the RP2040 actually has 4. Various other RP2040 development boards do make it easy to access all 4 analog pins, which is more suitable for building a 4-panel dance pad.

To run the FSR firmware on an RP2040-based device, download the RP2040 Arduino Core from https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico, and follow the setup instructions.

After installing the Arduino core, select your board from the Tools menu. It will be inside the **Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040** group. Make sure the "USB Stack" option in the Tools menu is set to "Pico SDK."
